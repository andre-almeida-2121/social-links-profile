### What I learned

I learned a few more things about HTML and CSS, including some important details that can be really significant for the website's visual and responsiveness. Indeed, these challenges gave me an idea, so I will probably update this section with interesting news soon.

### Continued development

I could notice how CSS really matter for the website's visual, so I'm looking forward to giving it more attention.
